### Hi there 👋

I'm Ignacio (but you can call me Nacho 😏), a junior Data Scientist starting his journey in the thrilling and dynamic world of analytics!
<br />
I really enjoy learning Python, R and other tools applied to Data Science, as well as tech and improving my communication skills in a more broad sense. 
<br />
